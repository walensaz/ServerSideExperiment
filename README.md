# ServerSideExperiment
My first couple attempts at server-side code using Java and Sockets.
This more or less shows the path I took to learning Server -> Client relations and how Sockets work.  You can see in each project how I progressed along and continued improving old systems.  I understand I still have stuff to work out, and obviously these aren't all my attempts, just the most notable onces that show my progression.
