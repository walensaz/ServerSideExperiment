This is my most current attempt at trying to use Server -> Client Sockets.  This attempt had much better structure and the use of Packets was very beneficial.  The way that I accept and hand off the packet was also much better, and it was a lot less manual coding.  I also feel that the way that I setup here would make it easier for multiple people to edit, whereas the other project only one person(me) would really be able to add more packets and such.  This way they can all extend and implement the packet classes I setup.
